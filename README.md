This repository contains an example of a Conceptual Model of a simple radiology clinic that conforms with the HCCM Standard.
The CM is available as a website at XX and a pdf.
Currently both the web and pdf version are created using Quarto and manually writing the .qmd file(s).
The goal is to eventually have an electronic representation of the CM (probably in JSON or XML) and then automatically generate the web and pdf versions of the CM from this.
